# SORTEE Code Club  
&nbsp;  
  
## What is Code Club?  
  
SORTEE Code Club is an online meeting where people come together to learn, share, and collaborate on coding-related topics in an informal and supportive environment. It’s not about being an experienced coder, it’s about **open science**, **peer learning**, and making coding more **accessible**, and most importantly **reproducible**  for everyone.  
  
&nbsp;  

## Why Code Club?  
  
At SORTEE we believe in **transparency, reproducibility, collaboration and accessibility in research** and coding is a big part of that! 
&nbsp;  
The SORTEE Code Club is a place to:  
- Learn and develop coding skills;  
- Discuss and develop resources for code review, reproducibility, open workflows, and best practices;  
- Share code-related issues and solutions;  
- Connect with others who care about open and reproducible research.


If you work with code, or if you would like to, and care for open science, this club is for you!  

&nbsp;  
## How is Code Club organized?   
  
We meet online **every third Tuesday of the month**. Meeting times and topics are announced on [SORTEE’s Slack](https://www.sortee.org/join/) (\#sortee-announcements, \#code\_club)**.** Find upcoming topics and times in the [**Code Club schedule**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rOOOE7ghPduwtFftG0DJJf0DXVigAdcmQ0xdEwbKQXo/edit?usp=sharing).  
&nbsp;   
We currently have two meeting formats:  
&nbsp;    
- **Training Sessions**: Focused sessions to learn new coding skills, packages, models, and exploring tools that support open science.  
- **Hacky Hours**: Casual peer-to-peer sessions where we review code, troubleshoot issues, and share tips and tricks.  
&nbsp;  
**Propose a topic** – Have a topic idea? Let us know via [this form](https://forms.gle/eZy81dUymiZNJetu8)\!

## SORTEE Open Code Resources  
  
Find here resources related to code review, reproducibility, and best practices that have been developed in previous Code Club sessions!  
&nbsp;   
**[Implementing code review in the scientific workflow](https://doi.org/10.1111/jeb.14230)**: open access review paper discussing the what, why, and how of code review for improving research reliability and reproducibility.  
[**SORTEE Code Standard**](https://github.com/SORTEE/CodeStandard) **(under development):** A piece of code with accompanying metadata files that can be used as an accessible and easy way to implement Open, Reliable, and Transparent (ORT) practices in your own coding by example.  
[**SORTEE Library of Code Mistakes**:](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12QN3WUc5v1Df7OArEox2U7l_N_qnHHuwzjCYiI4idC8/edit?usp=sharing) A growing collection of code mistakes shared by SORTEE to (1) normalise coding errors and (2) build a resource of (common) code mistakes that you can use during code review.  
[**Find an ORTEE Code Reviewer**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eHdU8o0psUj6Y4dPxqA-uW8Fc8SQVwzY1BnEbXM5k54/edit?usp=sharing)**:** List to find or suggest code reviewers. You can request a code review at any stage in the research cycle, i.e. during development, immediately pre-publication or post-publication. **If you are interested in promoting open, reliable, and transparent research practices, and are willing to be contacted as a potential code reviewer, please add your details to this sheet!**

As part of the SORTEE 2021 conference, we organised a hackathon event to collaboratively work on infographics related to Open Science. We now finished two infographics from this event. You can provide us with your feedback on these, and/or express your interest in participating in future similar hackathons organised by the SORTEE Infographics Task Force.

# Upcoming events    

&nbsp;

## March 2023

### **Title:** *UK ambassadors for life sciences data stewardship*    
**Presenters:** Gabriela Lopez-Gonzalez (University of Leeds), Richard Ostler (Rothamsted Research), Xenia Perez Sitja (University of Bradford/ELIXIR-UK)     
**Type:** Webinar       
**Date and Time:** March 30 2023 at 16:00 UTC   
**Timezone(s):** Americas/Europe    
**Duration:** 1h 30 minutes (max)   
**Summary:** Data Stewardship has grown over the last years as an emerging key role for high-performing research. Stewards are not only crucial to managing research data but also building capacity and advocating for institutional, national and international policy changes. Yet, steps need to be taken to professionalise this critical role of data stewards beyond the go-to person in a team who knows about data. 

In 2021, ELIXIR-UK was granted a UKRI award for the [ELIXIR-UK Fellowship](https://elixiruknode.org/activities/elixir-dash-fellowship/), building capacity and professionalising data stewardship. It leverages local expertise with a community of Fellows from diverse research-performing organisations in the UK – creating a data management culture change from within the institutions.

This webinar will explore the model of this Fellowship and its current outputs. Attendees will also hear first-hand experiences from two of the Fellows: Gabriela Lopez Gonzalez (long-term monitoring of peatland data, working with ecologists, conservation organisations and volunteers) and Richard Ostler (crop traits, soil chemistry and physics, environmental/sensor datasets, agroecological and agronomic data).    

**Registration:** register on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/uk-ambassadors-for-life-sciences-data-stewardship-tickets-583792157057)

## Febuary 2023  

### **Title:** *Equitability in data reuse in microbial ecology*   
**Presenter:** Dr. Stephanie Jurburg  
**Type:** Webinar   
**Date and time:** Feb 20 2023 at 14:00 UTC   
**Timezone(s):** Americas/Europe  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
**Summary:** Data collection, management, and reuse are increasingly important in ecology and biodiversity research. In microbial ecology, sequencing has altered our relationship to the hidden microbial world and created massive amounts of reusable microbiome data. These data can now be used to integrate bacteria into macroecology and to fill major gaps in the field through synthesis. However, ~50% of archived sequence data is not reusable, and biodiversity blind spots remain, especially in regions where the lack of access to scientific resources precludes the generation, archiving, and reuse of sequence data. This webinar will explore the current limitations to sequence data reuse in microbial ecology, and explore how promoting equitability in research through dedicated database creation and outreach can overcome them. Though we will discuss these issues through the lens of microbial ecology, this webinar is relevant to anyone interested in issues of open data and equity.

## January 2023  

### **Title:** *Using and contributing open data to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)*   
**Presenter:** Carole Sinou  
**Type:** Workshop  
**Date and time:** Jan 24 2023 at 10:00 EST (UTC 15:00)  
**Timezone(s):** Americas/Europe  
**Duration:** 1.5 hour  
**Summary:** GBIF is an international network and data infrastructure funded by the world's governments and aimed at providing anyone, anywhere, open access to data about all types of life on Earth. Many countries and organizations have deployed infrastructures aimed at facilitating publication of biodiversity data on GBIF.

During this workshop, you will learn how you can contribute different types of data to GBIF, providing visibility to your institution/project and allowing others to use data you collected.

You will also discover how you can use GBIF mediated data in your own research and projects. Filtering data from GBIF allows users to generate fit-for-purpose datasets that can then be used for different types of analyses, such as ecological niche modeling and species distributions.  

**Materials:** [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18xkf76c1b9zV4fwblZ0-0V6Xx2EiB2wUI1E1nerPQ50/edit?usp=share_link)

**Timezone(s):** Americas/Europe   	  
**Duration:** 1 hour	  
**Summary:** Motivation for using OER in E&E classes and how to find and implement these resources.  
Objective 1: Describe some of the benefits of implementing OER in E&E classes.  
Objective 2: Find OER resources, with a focus on open textbooks, of relevance to your courses.   
Objective 3: Learn the basics of using Libretexts to remix OER and create content fine-tuned to your courses.

## November 2022    

### **Title:** *An Ecologist’s Introduction to Transitioning into Data Science*    
**Presenter:** Alessandro Filazzola and Sophie Breitbart    
**Type:** Workshop    
**Date and time:** Nov 2nd 2022 at 10:00 EDT (UTC 14:00)   
**Timezone(s):** Americas/Europe      	  
**Duration:** 2 hours	  
**Summary:** Ecological researchers have skills that are highly transferable, especially in data science. We provide suggestions on why data science may be a suitable alternative to a career in ecology and steps towards becoming a data scientist.    
   Objective 1:  Contextualize data science for ecologists including defining what is data science, the overlaps with ecology, and what a career in data science may look like,    
   Objective 2:  Provide a brief introduction to SQL, one of the most frequently used tools by data scientists,    
   Objective 3:  Detail actions and strategies for transitioning into data science.    

**Materials:** [DataSci_for_Ecologists](https://github.com/sbreitbart/DataSci_for_Ecologists) and [SQL_intro](https://sbreitbart.github.io/DataSci_for_Ecologists/SQL_intro/SQL_intro.html)

**Timezone(s):** Australasia		 
**Duration:** 2 hours  	  
**Summary:** Using the targets R package to create reproducible data analysis pipelines.

  Objective 2: Specify, run and query the outputs of a small data analysis pipeline using the targets infrastructure.

     - using the the outputs of a targets pipeline in literate programming documents,  
     - incorporating literate programming documents into the targets pipeline, and  
     - batching and iterating tasks using branching in targets  
  Objective 4: Troubleshoot and debug a targets pipeline so you can apply this knowledge to synthesise targets workflows for your own data analyses.

SORTEE members attend many different (in-person, hybrid, or online) conferences in different disciplines all around the world. The purpose of this page is to help you meet up with other SORTEE members at these conferences and / or to spread the word about SORTEE at these conferences.    

[Find out what SORTEE meet-ups have already been scheduled at in-person conferences.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QfzSdTNzRR-gbILW2BNqrQTpWIjduR-7Jtw2lataGbk/edit?usp=sharing)     

Would you like to schedule a meet-up with other SORTEE members (or people interested in SORTEE) at the conference? We can then coordinate with you to advertise this meet-up on the SORTEE website and on social media. [Please let us know that you want to organise a SORTEE meet-up here!](https://forms.gle/rEXRYNoCXWBDFiLPA)   

You are of course welcome to meet with SORTEE members at conferences without having to inform us, but if you want us to announce the meet-up and to support you (e.g. with stickers and posters), please let us know in the form above.

## Guidelines and conditions for representing SORTEE    

### Expressions of interest
[Apply to represent SORTEE at a conference](https://forms.gle/rEXRYNoCXWBDFiLPA)

After submitting the expression of interest form we will contact you to work out the details.  We have a limited amount of funds available to support costs such as printing posters, mailing SORTEE stickers and t-shirts, and buying food and drinks for meet-up attendees.
If you do not hear from us within a week, do not hesitate to send an email to [community.sortee@gmail.com](mailto:community.sortee@gmail.com).

### Presentation of SORTEE promotional material
If you would like to present SORTEE promotional material at a conference (online, hybrid, in-person), such as a poster, a presentation, an informational booth, etc., we have promotional material available and you can express your interest via the same form. 
To grant you access, we request that you 1) are a current SORTEE member, and 2) agree to abide by [SORTEE’s Code of Conduct](https://www.sortee.org/codeofconduct/) when acting as a representative of SORTEE.

### In-person meet ups at conferences
As a SORTEE member attending a conference in-person, we may be able to support you logistically and financially to host an in-person meet-up. At meet-ups, SORTEE members (and potential members) gather in an informal setting to discuss open science and feel connected to the SORTEE community.

We request that you choose a location that is accessible, safe, and inclusive for all conference attendees, such as an accessible space within the conference venue, or an outdoor cafe/bar/restaurant in a safe neighborhood (with consideration to gender, sexual identities, ethnicities, and disabilities). The venue should not exclusively serve alcohol. For advice on the venue, please contact the local conference organisers.

We expect to be able to cover a few in-person meetups per year. Should there be competition for funding, we will allocate funds to meet-ups organised at conferences which have the largest and most diverse audience within the field of ecology and evolutionary biology.

### Handling issues
Meet-up hosts must agree to abide by [SORTEE’s Code of Conduct](https://www.sortee.org/codeofconduct/), and to support the reporting of any violations of the code of conduct via our reporting form. In urgent situations event organizers have the authority to enforce violations of the [Code of Conduct](https://www.sortee.org/codeofconduct/) without the need to first consult the SORTEE Board of Directors.

### 2025 Membership   

[Become a SORTEE member in 2025](https://www.joinit.org/o/sortee/)

In 2022, we moved to a suggested membership fee model to support the society’s continued operation and growth (e.g., board insurance, website hosting, membership management software, stipends to monthly workshop and webinar speakers, legal and administrative fees, etc.). 

We kept the 2022 suggested membership fees the same for 2023, 2024, and 2025 (amounts are in US$):
* Senior-career professionals: $40
* Early-career professionals: $20
* Students: $10
* Pay No Fees: Free
* Pay What You Can: Minimum $0.50 (50 cents)

**Pay What You Can:** Besides the Pay No Fees option (no questions asked), we are offering everyone an option to enter a different payment amount. This option is intended for people who need to pay less (e.g. to account for exchange rates or personal financial difficulty), and for those who have the means to pay more and would like to make a larger donation to support SORTEE’s activities.

To join SORTEE or update your membership details, please go to: [https://www.joinit.org/o/sortee/](https://www.joinit.org/o/sortee/).  

Note that this fee covers an annual membership to SORTEE and expires on the 31st December at the end of each calendar year.

### Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) at SORTEE   

At SORTEE, we place great importance on DEI. We have a dedicated DEI committee to ensure that we keep making improvements on this topic. We thereby also seek the help of our members. You can help us by filling out our demographic survey, whenever you become a member or renew your membership. This survey informs us on what our members think of diversity and also on which directions we may need to take for the future.    

Our goal is to be diverse and inclusive of people across disciplines, from various geographical locations, from under-represented groups and with various interests.

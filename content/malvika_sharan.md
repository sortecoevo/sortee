**Talk title:** The Turing Way Guide to Reproducible, Ethical and Collaborative Research   

**Talk abstract:**  As researchers, we make complex choices around project design and decision making throughout the lifecycle of our research. We must ensure that our research objects are easily accessed, openly examined and built upon by others in future work. Although open and transparent reporting is necessary to ensure that scientific work can be trusted, it is also crucial to integrate consideration of the societal and ethical implications of our work: especially when it impacts people's lives. Furthermore, reproducible research practices are important for ensuring that research methods, underlying data, analysis code and workflows can be independently verified. These require understanding of research best practices and skills that are often not widely taught or explored among academic researchers.   

In this talk, I will introduce The Turing Way - an open source community-driven guide to reproducible, ethical and inclusive data science and research. Our goal is to provide all the information that researchers, industry professionals and community leaders need at the start of their projects to ensure that they maintain the highest reproducible and ethical standards at all stages of development. All attendees will leave the talk understanding the many dimensions of openness and how they can participate in an inclusive, kind and inspiring open source ecosystem as they collaboratively seek to improve research culture. All questions and contributions are welcome at [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).   

**Brief bio:** Malvika Sharan is the community lead of The Turing Way project at The Alan Turing institute that aims to make data science reproducible, ethical and inclusive for researchers around the globe. She involves and supports a diverse community of contributors helping them adopt best practices in their research, exchange data skills and collaborate within The Turing Way.    
She is a co-founder of Open Life Science, a mentoring and training programme that empowers researchers to integrate open science in the context of their communities. After receiving her PhD in Bioinformatics, she started her career in open source community building at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. She is a Software Sustainability Institute fellow, Open Bioinformatics Foundation board member and an active contributor of open source projects. Connect with her to discuss and collaborate on building resources, promoting open practices and supporting projects to enhance the diversity of marginalised members in research leadership.

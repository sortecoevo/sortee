SORTEE members attend many different (in-person, hybrid, or online) conferences in different disciplines all around the world. The purpose of this page is to help you meet up with other SORTEE members at these conferences and / or to spread the word about SORTEE at these conferences.    

[Find out what SORTEE meet-ups have already been scheduled at in-person conferences.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QfzSdTNzRR-gbILW2BNqrQTpWIjduR-7Jtw2lataGbk/edit?usp=sharing)     

Would you like to schedule a meet-up with other SORTEE members (or people interested in SORTEE) at the conference? We can then coordinate with you to advertise this meet-up on the SORTEE website and on social media. [Please let us know that you want to organise a SORTEE meet-up here!](https://forms.gle/rEXRYNoCXWBDFiLPA)   

You are of course welcome to meet with SORTEE members at conferences without having to inform us, but if you want us to announce the meet-up and to support you (e.g. with stickers and posters), please let us know in the form above.

## Guidelines and conditions for representing SORTEE    

### Expressions of interest
[Apply to represent SORTEE at a conference](https://forms.gle/rEXRYNoCXWBDFiLPA)

After submitting the expression of interest form we will contact you to work out the details.  We have a limited amount of funds available to support costs such as printing posters, mailing SORTEE stickers and t-shirts, and buying food and drinks for meet-up attendees.
If you do not hear from us within a week, do not hesitate to send an email to [community.sortee@gmail.com](mailto:community.sortee@gmail.com).

### Presentation of SORTEE promotional material
If you would like to present SORTEE promotional material at a conference (online, hybrid, in-person), such as a poster, a presentation, an informational booth, etc., we have promotional material available and you can express your interest via the same form. 
To grant you access, we request that you 1) are a current SORTEE member, and 2) agree to abide by [SORTEE’s Code of Conduct](https://www.sortee.org/codeofconduct/) when acting as a representative of SORTEE.

### In-person meet ups at conferences
As a SORTEE member attending a conference in-person, we may be able to support you logistically and financially to host an in-person meet-up. At meet-ups, SORTEE members (and potential members) gather in an informal setting to discuss open science and feel connected to the SORTEE community.

We request that you choose a location that is accessible, safe, and inclusive for all conference attendees, such as an accessible space within the conference venue, or an outdoor cafe/bar/restaurant in a safe neighborhood (with consideration to gender, sexual identities, ethnicities, and disabilities). The venue should not exclusively serve alcohol. For advice on the venue, please contact the local conference organisers.

We expect to be able to cover a few in-person meetups per year. Should there be competition for funding, we will allocate funds to meet-ups organised at conferences which have the largest and most diverse audience within the field of ecology and evolutionary biology.

### Handling issues
Meet-up hosts must agree to abide by [SORTEE’s Code of Conduct](https://www.sortee.org/codeofconduct/), and to support the reporting of any violations of the code of conduct via our reporting form. In urgent situations event organizers have the authority to enforce violations of the [Code of Conduct](https://www.sortee.org/codeofconduct/) without the need to first consult the SORTEE Board of Directors.

### Symposium + Meet-up at ESEB in Barcelona, Spain (Aug, 2025)

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Organizer:** | Tom Ratz, Ed Ivimey-Cook |
| **Summary:** | SORTEE hosted a symposium on open science at the 2025 ESEB Conference in Barcelona, Spain. It was hugely successful and well received! The symposium was hosted by current SORTEE president Ed Ivimey-Cook and president-elect, Marija Purgar. We had six fantastic speakers, including an invited talk by Dr. Malgorzata (Losia) Lagisz (Board and committee member), who discussed inclusive meta-research for transparency; and Joel Pick (Chair of the Advocacy committee) who discussed the role of journals in promoting diverse and credible research culture. Both of these talks showcased the large variety of research happening at SORTEE.<br><br>Other talk topics ranged from the importance of career breaks to lessons learned from Covid-19 on Open Science practices. SORTEE also had a number of poster presentations that further highlighted the many diverse open science initiatives across EcoEvo.<br><br>SORTEE also organised a well-attended meetup for anyone interested in open science and SORTEE. |

### Meet-up at EOU in Wales (Aug, 2025)

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Organizer:** | Giulia Masoero, Matthieu Paquet |
| **Summary:** | Earlier the same day, Antica gave a plenary presentation about ORT Science (open data, open code, and registration). She encouraged people to join SORTEE and advertised the round table discussion later the same day. The round table was at the same time of the second hour of the poster session which was a bit unfortunate but still we were 17 people from various career stages. We shared about open data, open code, preregistration and registered reports (briefly about diamond open access but didn't have much time). Every person spoke during the roundtable which was great. We shared about open vs FAIR data. Some people were worried about making all long term datasets open but thought it was important to have FAIR data checked when publishing and deposited (but not necessarily open). We shared about the pressure (sometimes self imposed) to have significant results and how we can reduce this pressure (notably when acting as reviewers). Also how to make code clubs less intimidating. After one hour of round table some of us went to a pub nearby to continue discussing more informally. We felt that it was a very successful event. |

### Meet-up at AOS in St. Louis, USA (Aug, 2025)

| **Organizer:** | Tim Parker |
| **Summary:** | Approximately 10 people attended the meet-up. Including the organizer, this included four SORTEE members (or former SORTEE members), and several people who had learned about SORTEE at the conference (mostly students). Also, I gave away many stickers and talked to many people about SORTEE. |

### Meet-up at CSEE in Sherbrooke, Canada (Jul, 2025)

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Organizer:** | Tim Parker |
| **Summary:** | Approximately 10 people attended the meet-up. The meet-up consisted primarily of people who were involved in a symposium on open science / science reliability at the conference. The meet-up included a mix of existing or past SORTEE members and others interested in SORTEE-related issues but previously unfamiliar with SORTEE. |

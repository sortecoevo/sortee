# Collaborative projects 

## SORTEE hackathons and projects - what are they?

*SORTEE hackathons are 1-2 hour virtual events held during annual SORTEE conferences. They usually facilitate group projects with well-defined goals, such as implementing advocacy actions, conceptualising or drafting documents, testing methods or software, etc. The list below presents descriptions of selected examples of past hackathons and related projects. If you would like to learn more, please contact the respective project leads (names provided below).*

Selected past SORTEE hackathons, and related past and ongoing collaborative projects:

## 2021

### **Short Title: Registered Reports Now**

**Led by:** Patrice Pottier,  Shinichi Nakagawa, Cooper Smout

**Type:** Advocacy; Year Started: 2021; Status: finished 

**Purpose & Methods:** This hackathon aimed to promote the implementation of registered reports in ecology and evolutionary biology, a publication format that enhances research transparency but remains underutilized. Participants learned about registered reports, discussed barriers to their adoption, and collectively emailed journal editors requesting their implementation. A prepared list of journals and email templates facilitated this process, maximizing outreach efforts.

**Skills Required:** This hackathon was open to everyone---no specific skills were required to participate.

**Additional Work & Outcomes:** There were no mandatory tasks following the hackathon, but participants were encouraged to follow up with journal editors if they did not receive a response. The list of journals was made publicly available for further outreach. While no publishable content was expected, the event aimed to drive real-world change by promoting registered reports in academic publishing.

**Outputs:** database of contacted journals. One journal (i.e., Ethology) adopted Registered Reports in response to this hackathon. 

### **Short Title: Promoting GitHub Use in EcoEvo**

**Led by:** Robert Crystal-Ornelas, Katherine Hébert, Emma Hudgins, Pedro Henrique Pereira Braga, Luna L. Sanchez-Reyes, Ciera Martinez

**Type:** Education & Collaboration; Year Started: 2021; Status: Finished

**Purpose & Methods:** This hackathon aimed to identify, discuss, and propose innovative uses of GitHub in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology for career support, open science, education, and outreach. Participants explored various ways ecologists and evolutionary biologists use GitHub, including visualizing data, career support, research documentation, and programming assistance. Breakout groups discussed challenges, advantages, and specific use cases, followed by a collaborative manuscript-writing session to synthesize key insights.

**Skills Required:** Basic knowledge of GitHub was helpful but not required. Anyone collaborating on documents, websites, manuscripts, or interested in data and code-sharing policies in Ecology and Evolution could contribute.

**Additional Work & Outcomes:** Two months after the hackathon, session organizers wrote a blog post summarizing the discussions. A manuscript was developed through remote collaboration via monthly meetings, Slack discussions, and GitHub-based writing.

**Outputs:** A blog post and a peer-reviewed manuscript - Braga, P. H. P., Hébert, K., Hudgins, E. J., Scott, E. R., Edwards, B. P. M., Sánchez Reyes, L. L., Grainger, M. J., Foroughirad, V., Hillemann, F., Binley, A. D., Brookson, C. B., Gaynor, K. M., Shafiei Sabet, S., Güncan, A., Weierbach, H., Gomes, D. G. E., & Crystal-Ornelas, R. (2023). Not just for programmers: How GitHub can accelerate collaborative and reproducible research in ecology and evolution. Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 14, 1364--1380. <https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14108>.

### **Short Title: SORTEE Infographic Tools**

**Led by:** Malgorzata (Losia) Lagisz, Szymon Drobniak, Samantha Burke, Bawan Amin

**Type:** Resource Development; Year Started: 2021; Status: Finished (continued in 2022 as another hackathon)

**Purpose & Methods:** This hackathon aimed to create visual educational and outreach materials for SORTEE, focusing on infographics related to preprints, registration, guidelines, workflows, and questionable research practices. Before the hackathon, an information package was prepared, including introductory materials on infographic design and a survey to assess participant skills and contributions. During the event, participants were divided into small groups to draft infographics which were later professionally edited.

**Skills Required:** Anyone could participate, and no special skills were required.

**Additional Work & Outcomes:** Hackathon participants were not expected to produce final publication-quality infographics. After the event, facilitators coordinated revisions and selected drafts for finalization. All contributors were asked to complete CRediT statements, which were made publicly available alongside the final infographics.

**Outputs:** A set of infographics hosted on the [SORTEE website](%5Bhttps://www.sortee.org/infographics/).

### **Short Title: Reproducibility of ecological results**

**Led by:** Alfredo Sánchez-Tójar, Antica Culina, Simon Evans (currently also: Marija Purgar)

**Type:** Resource Development & Education; Year Started: 2021, repeated in 2022;  Status: Ongoing

**Purpose & Methods:** This hackathon(s) aimed to test whether open code increases the computational reproducibility of published findings. For that, each participant was asked to try to computationally reproduce the results of a provided ecological article. The subset of articles corresponded to articles previously identified to have provided both data and code by Culina et al. (2020). Each article was assigned to at least two participants, one time the participant would have access to both the data and code, and one time the participant would only have access to the data. Participants will be offered a co-authorship on a resulting paper.

**Skills Required:** Basic knowledge of one of the main statistical packages used in the subset of ecological studies that we will attempt to reproduce (namely R or Python) and be highly motivated about the hackathon.

**Additional Work & Outcomes:** Participants will be offered to contribute to the writing of this manuscript after the first draft is ready. We have recently finished cleaning up the data and have started drafting a manuscript.

**Outputs:** TBA.

### **Short Title: Peer Code Review Rubric Development**

**Led by:** Saras Windecker Year Started: 2021 **Type:** Resource Development; Status: Finished (continued in 2022 as another hackathon and SORTEE Code Club)

**Purpose & Methods:** This hackathon aimed to develop a model for peer code review in ecology and evolutionary biology. Participants worked to create a rubric for peer code review, along with guidelines for its use. The hackathon also explored ways to formalize peer code review processes, inspired by software code review practices such as those used by ROpenSci.

**Skills Required:** Anyone with an interest in promoting peer code review was welcome to participate.

**Additional Work & Outcomes:** Participants had the opportunity to continue collaborating after the hackathon to further develop and promote the peer code review rubric.

**Outputs:** A peer code review rubric [OSF Project Page](%5Bhttps://osf.io/kncw6/wiki/home/) and a blog post [SORTEE Blog](%5Bhttps://www.sortee.org/blog/2024/05/03/202404_code_club/).

### **Short Title: Creating a SORTEE Wikipedia Page**

**Led by:** Tim Parker

**Type:** Resource Development; Year Started: 2024; Status: On Hold (waiting for more publications about SORTEE)

**Purpose & Methods:** This hackathon aimed to create a draft Wikipedia page for SORTEE. Participants first reviewed Wikipedia's article creation guidelines before dividing tasks into three areas: Composing sections of text, Identifying relevant citations, Importing content into a Wikipedia draft article.

**Skills Required:** No specialized skills were required.

**Additional Work & Outcomes:** The project is currently on hold, awaiting more published references about SORTEE to meet Wikipedia's notability requirements.

**Outputs:** A draft Wikipedia page for SORTEE (pending further development and approval).

### **Short Title: Creating a Code Standard**

**Led by:** Natalie van Dis, Arthur Rodrigues

Year Started: 2024

Status: In Progress 

**Type:** Resource Development

**Purpose & Methods:** This hackathon aimed to collaboratively develop a Code Standard: a piece of code with accompanying metadata files that can be used as an accessible and easy way to implement Open, Reliable, and Transparent (ORT) practices in your own coding by example. The initiative started as part of [\*\*SORTEE's Code Club](%5Bhttps://www.sortee.org/code_club/)\*\*, focused on facilitating the production and reviewing of ORT code in ecology and evolution research. Before the hackathon, a poll was conducted to determine which coding languages to include. A GitHub repository was prepared with example R code from a published ecology/evolution study. During the hackathon, participants were divided into breakout rooms, each focusing on specific aspects of code review based on the 4R's of code review: Reported, Run, Reliable, Reproducible. Attendees worked together to refine the code and submit improvements via Git. The latest version of the curated ORT code, along with documentation of the curation process, is openly available on GitHub.

**Skills Required:** Participants needed a GitHub account and experience in coding for scientific analysis. The number of coding languages addressed depended on the available expertise and collected code examples, and ended up being one R script from a published paper.

**Additional Work & Outcomes:** The project is ongoing, refining the ORT Code Standard further and expanding its accessibility. Once the Code Standard is finished and published on Github, we will write an accompanying paper to reach a wide audience of potential users for this resource in the fields of Ecology and Evolution.

**Outputs:** GitHub Repository: [SORTEE Code Standard](%5Bhttps://github.com/SORTEE/CodeStandard) and a [blog post](%5Bhttps://www.sortee.org/blog/2024/12/09/202410_code_club/). Manuscript in preparation.

### About SORTEE conferences

*Our conferences are informative, fun and low-cost.*

The conference is a forum to **discuss** and **develop ideas**, while also exploring **current practices** for advancing research in fields related to ecology and evolutionary biology. 

   
The conference will be a mix of 5 session types:

 

-   **Unconferences:** Facilitated discussions of ideas for how to make ecology, evolutionary biology, and related disciplines more open, reliable, and transparent. 

-   **Hackathons:** Group projects with well-defined goals (papers, techniques, software, protocols, organizations, etc.).

-   **Workshops:** Facilitators will teach tools to implement open, reliable, and transparent practices.

-   **Plenaries**: Two plenaries about recent initiatives in open science.

-   **Introductions to open science:** Two sessions dedicated to people new to open science.

### About SORTEE conferences ###
Our conferences are informative, fun and low-cost and is a forum to **discuss and develop ideas**, while also exploring **current practices** for advancing research in fields related to ecology and evolutionary biology.  

&nbsp;   
The conference will be a mix of 5 session types:  

&nbsp;  
    
**1.** **Unconferences**: Facilitated discussions of ideas for how to make ecology, evolutionary biology, and related disciplines more open, reliable, and transparent. Facilitation involves moderating the conversation with ideas and examples, but there are no formal presentations.  
**2.** **Hackathons**: Group projects with well-defined goals (papers, techniques, software, protocols, organizations, etc.).  
**3.** **Workshops**: Teach tips and tools for producing open, reliable and transparent research practices.  
**4.** **Plenaries**: Two plenaries about recent initiatives in open science.

# SORTEE Conference 2025 #  

***Virtual & world-wide!***  

&nbsp; 
  
The 2025 SORTEE conference will run continuously from [15 October 07:00 UTC to 16 October 10:00 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=SORTEE+2025+Conference&iso=20251015T07&p1=1440&ah=23&am=55) to cover all time zones.   

&nbsp; 
  
*Content submissions are now OPEN.* Submit here: [https://forms.gle/QRsrgU2kNTVS7ZET8](https://forms.gle/QRsrgU2kNTVS7ZET8)  

&nbsp; 
  
We accept the following types of proposals:  
 
&nbsp; 
  
**Unconferences**: Facilitated discussions of ideas for how to make ecology, evolutionary biology, and related disciplines more open, reliable, and transparent. Facilitation involves moderating the conversation with ideas and examples, but there are no formal presentations.  
**Hackathons**: Group projects with well-defined goals (papers, techniques, software, protocols, organizations, etc.).  
**Workshops**: Teach tips and tools for producing open, reliable and transparent research practices.  
&nbsp; 
  
You are also welcome to submit a proposal and facilitate your session in a language other than English. We will organise live translation during the conference to support this.  
  
&nbsp;  
The conference is FREE for [SORTEE members](https://www.sortee.org/join/), and the cost for non-SORTEE members ranges from $0 to $60. 
  
&nbsp;   
We strongly encourage proposals for all contribution types from people at a wide range of career stages and from members of under-represented groups. We welcome proposals from small teams, as well as individuals. We encourage teams to include diverse perspectives, for instance with facilitators from different countries and balanced in terms of gender and career stage. Facilitation by early career researchers (students or early career postdocs) is warmly encouraged.  
  
&nbsp;   
We encourage people with any questions about accessibility in the submission process or the conference itself to contact us via [conference@sortee.org](mailto:conference@sortee.org). Similarly, please feel free to contact us if you would like guidance as you prepare your proposals.

## About SORTEE conferences

*Our conferences are informative, fun and low-cost*  
 

We want to facilitate lively exchanges of ideas, with three participatory event types:  
- **Unconferences:** Facilitated discussions of ideas for how to make ecology, evolutionary biology, and related disciplines more open, reliable, and transparent. Facilitation involves moderating the conversation with ideas and examples, but there are no formal presentations.

-   **Hackathons:** Group projects with well-defined goals (papers, techniques, software, protocols, organizations, etc.)

-   **Workshops:** Facilitators will teach tools to implement open, reliable, and transparent practices

 

We strongly encourage proposals for all contribution types from people at a wide range of career stages and from members of under-represented groups.

For facilitated sessions (Workshops, Unconferences, and Hackathons), we welcome proposals from small teams (as well as individuals). We encourage teams to include diverse perspectives, for instance with facilitators from different countries and balanced in terms of gender and career stage. Facilitation by early career researchers (students or early career postdocs) is warmly encouraged.

We encourage people with any questions about accessibility in the submission process or the events themselves to contact us via [conf.sortee@gmail.com](mailto:conf.sortee@gmail.com). Similarly, please feel free to contact us if you would like guidance as you prepare your proposals and submissions.

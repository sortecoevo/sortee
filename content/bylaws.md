The President shall preside at all meetings of the directors; the President shall see that all orders and resolutions of the Board are carried into effect, subject, however, to the right of the directors to delegate any specific powers, except such as may be by statute exclusively conferred on the President, to any other officer or officers of the Corporation.

Election or appointment of an officer or agent shall not of itself create contract rights. Removal as an officer shall also constitute removal from the Executive Committee, if such committee is created.

**6.7** Resignation. Any officer may resign from office at any time, such resignation to be made in writing and to take effect from the time of its receipt by the Corporation, unless some other time be fixed in the resignation, and then from that time.

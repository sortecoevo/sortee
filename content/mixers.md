## Social Mixers - first Tuesday of every month

Come and meet or catch up with other SORTEE members over Zoom on the first Tuesday of every month! We’ll play games together (but no worries if you don’t want to play), and there will be plenty of time for chatting. Check the [SORTEE Slack](https://sortee.slack.com/) (#sortee-announcements) for details (time and link) each month. To receive calendar invites in your local time zone, sign up [here](https://forms.gle/yKrEm6xAKZtom5kt7).

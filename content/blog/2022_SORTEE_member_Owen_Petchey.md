*[SORTEE member voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_Name:_ Owen Petchey.   
&nbsp;

_Date:_ 19 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

_Research and/or work interests:_ Ecological responses to environmental change.   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_How did you become interested in open research?_   
Some years ago I was particularly interested in a published research report that included the data. I wanted to know more about how the quantitative analyses were done. So I downloaded the data, and set about reproducing the analyses. From that grew further interest, and then a class during which I and the participants worked on several similar reproductions. We learned a lot about how to prepare research reports and data so that they could be readily reproduced (and what not to do!). Some of the reports are published here: http://opetchey.github.io/RREEBES/

&nbsp;

_If you could start your career over again, but had to switch to another field or subdiscipline, what would you switch to? Why?_   
If I were to start my career again, and could not do what I'm now doing, I might try something very different, like professionally restoring antique cars.

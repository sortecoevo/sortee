&nbsp;

   _Name:_ Bárbara Freitas.   
&nbsp;

   _Date:_ 07 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

   _Position:_ PhD Student.   
&nbsp;

   _Research and/or work interests:_ Evolutionary biology; Speciation; Bioacoustics.   
&nbsp;

_What's an open science practice or topic that you've changed your views on within the last few years? Why?_   
Providing the package version that was used in each step of our work. My colleagues and I were trying to apply the methodology described in an article to our own data, and we were wasting too much time trying to find the correct version of each package that had been used. So I realized the importance of providing not only the version of the main software used, but also the package version numbers.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_What's the last book that affected the way you currently think about things?_   
The stranger - Albert Camus.

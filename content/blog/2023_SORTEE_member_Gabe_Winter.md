*[SORTEE member voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*

_Name:_ Gabe Winter _(they/any)_

_Date:_ 2 June 2023. 
&nbsp;

_Position:_ PhD candidate at Friedrich-Schiller University Jena, Germany.  
&nbsp;

_Research and/or work interests:_   
I am an ecologist, currently working with intra-individual variability in behaviour, but also super excited about open, transparent and reproducible research and data science.   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_What 'ORT' practice have you introduced into your research practice that you've found really helpful?_   
Having well documented R scripts have improved a lot my own reproducibility. Before, when I had to pause my analysis for a couple months (during field/lab work season, for example), it used to be tricky to remember what I was doing, and I usually had to start everything from the beginning. Now, using commented R markdowns I can simply continue from where I stopped every time. It takes some time to comment everything, but that same time (and more) is saved when I don't have to re-analyse from scratch.   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_What is something about your work in science that your friends outside of science (or the general public) would find surprising?_   
When I tell friends that my experiments consist of scaring grasshoppers to make them jump, I get some laughter in return.

*[SORTEE Member Voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*     
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

   _Name:_ **Kaitlin Kimmel**.   
&nbsp;

   _Date:_ 2 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

   _Position:_ Postdoc.   
&nbsp;

   _Research and/or work interests:_ Causes and consequences of biodiversity changes; functional traits; causal inference.   
&nbsp;

_What strategies/approaches do you think are most likely to lead to a research culture change?:_   
I think that adapting pre-registration and the registered report format will drastically improve our science. I know that we often do not distinguish between exploratory and confirmatory analyses - we usually just write the paper that we think will be the most interesting at the expense of being more transparent. I also think it is a good practice to think about what questions we really want to answer before starting an analysis.  
&nbsp;

_Tell us about one of your hobbies:_   
One of my newer hobbies is skijoring with my dog around our lake in the winter. We are not trying to train to enter any races - it is really just about connecting with my dog in nature, especially because I live where the winters are usually quite long!

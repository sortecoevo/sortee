   _Name:_ Gideon Deme Gywa.   
&nbsp;

   _Date:_ 09 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

   _Position:_ PhD candidate.   
&nbsp;

   _Research and/or work interests:_ I’m a PhD scholar at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and hosted at the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research over the years has focused on using theoretical models, experimental and field approaches to answer questions in evolutionary ecology, conservation of biodiversity in the ecosystem, and plastic waste management across the African continent. Overall, I am passionate about environmental protection and biodiversity conservation. Currently, I’m the project leader for the AFRICAN ECO-RESEARCH (AFRICER) project.

_What is an open / reliable / transparent science practice that you admire but have not yet adopted in your own work?_   
I so much admire the pre-registration of a study pipeline, and registered reports as implemented by some evolution and ecology journals. Pre-registration, I firmly believe, is a very excellent way to encourage transparency and openness among researchers in evolution and ecology. Pre-registering a study (manuscript) will provide authors with a kind of protection of ideas from p-hacking, which may reduce conflict of interest among competing research laboratories. This process helps researchers specify their ideas, data collection method, hypotheses testing method, and hypotheses confirmatory procedure in advance, which will increase the researcher's reliability and transparency, and provide the opportunity for the study to be repeated by different researchers in the same field. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_Where were you born and raised?_   
I was born in Ganawuri (a small hub) in Plateau State, North-Central Nigeria. I grew up with my paternal grandparents in the village, and it was fun; this may have shaped my interest in being an ecologist because of the mountains surrounding my hometown. However, in the mid-age of my growth, I had to move to the urban city of Jos for my education.

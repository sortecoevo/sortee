*[SORTEE member voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_Name:_ Malgorzata (Losia) Lagisz

_Date:_ 30 June 2023. 
&nbsp;

_Position:_ Research Fellow.  
&nbsp;

_Research and/or work interests:_   
I am a biologist with research experience and skills in different fields of science. I often venture outside biological topics and data, for example, into biomedical, environmental, conservation, or even social sciences. In my research, I use research synthesis methods, such as systematic reviews/maps and meta-analyses.   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_What do you see as the greatest challenge facing the open/reliable/transparent science movement at large or specifically in ecology and evolutionary biology?_   
Inertia - people, especially established researchers, are stuck in their way of doing science and thinking about science. Then they pass it on to their students.   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_What institutional policies do you see as most important to change to improve the reliability of science?_   
Prioritizing recognition for research being open, robust, and transparent - the whole system of incentives, but also values (beyond the lip service) must change. This applies to all levels and types of academic and professional recognition.   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_Where is someplace you've never visited but would like to? Why do you want to visit there?_   
Okinawa and surrounding islands in the tropical part of Japan. I would like to discover the secret of living to 100, especially if it involves amazing food and beautiful nature!   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_Tell us about one of your hobbies._   
I like hiking, horse riding, and mushroom picking (not necessarily at the same time, but I have a friend who can do it!). Unfortunately, I don't have many opportunities to do this.   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;


_What was your most embarrassing coding moment?_   
Realizing that I did not ask the person who collected the data about all the details (meta-data) and made assumptions that lead to having to discard and redo some of the analyses. Lesson learned - get all meta-data, don't make assumptions, and communicate.

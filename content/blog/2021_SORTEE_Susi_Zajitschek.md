*[SORTEE member voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

   _Name:_ Susi Zajitschek.   
&nbsp;

   _Date:_ 02 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

   _Position:_ Lecturer.   
&nbsp;

   _Research and/or work interests:_ I am interested in behavioural ecology and teaching.   
&nbsp;

_How did you become interested in open research?_   
Scientific integrity is often taken for granted, and while for the vast majority of researchers there is no question about this, there are the occasional cases of misconduct, shady/patchy reporting or non-reproducibility.  In the past, this may have happened "accidentally", with no means of violating best practise, but just based on lack of awareness. I am really happy that in the last few years so much effort has gone into ORT, this is really the way forward for science!
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_What 'ORT' practice have you introduced into your research practice that you've found really helpful?_   
I am using OSF for my projects, and aim to make these projects accessible along with work I publish. Also, the use of preprints is a great way to provide openly accessible versions of papers for everyone.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_What's the last book that affected the way you currently think about things?_   
Zen Soup, by Laurence Boldt. It is a bit dated, but a great easy introduction to mindfulness, taking yourself less seriously and accepting things as they are!

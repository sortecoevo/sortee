*[SORTEE member voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

   _Name:_ Fredrik Jutfelt.   
&nbsp;

   _Date:_ 02 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

   _Position:_ Professor.   
&nbsp;

   _Research and/or work interests:_ Animal physiology and behaviour, thermal biology.   
&nbsp;

_How did you become interested in open research?_   
I became interested in open research after realising scientific misconduct and data fabrication occurs in my field. That started me, together with a group of friends, on a path to investigate papers with suspicious results. When looking for raw data from published papers I found that  most authors don't share their data even when the journals mandate it. This clearly needs to change and I think SORTEE is a great starting point.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_Do you have a favorite non-human organism? What is it and why is it your favorite?_   
One of my favourite animals is the ocean sunfish, a gentle giant that eats jellies. I was always curious about how such a large and seemingly poor swimmer could survive without getting eaten, but after examining a large stranded individual in Norway I realised the skin is basically an exoskeleton, 10 cm thick!

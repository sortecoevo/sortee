*[SORTEE member voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

   _Name:_ Hannah Fraser.   
&nbsp;

   _Date:_ 04 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

   _Position:_ Postdoctoral Researcher.   
&nbsp;

   _Research and/or work interests:_ Ecology metascience. Bringing metascience insights from other disciplines to ecology.   
&nbsp;

_If you had the power to change one thing about current research practices in your field, what would it be?_   
If I could change one thing about current research practices I would like to see the incentive to publish research quickly removed so that people could conduct more careful, nuanced research.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_What's an 'ORT' subject or practice that you think deserves more attention?_   
I think the way people describe the generalisability of their work is an underappreciated ORT - there was a great paper by Simons, Shoda and Lindsay in 2017 "Constraints on Generality (COG): A Proposed Addition to All Empirical Papers" that talks about how to put sensible constraints on how you describe your results.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_What was your most embarrassing field work moment?_   
My most embarrassing field work moment was, while working as an RA on a project, getting caught in a barbed wire fence and needing someone else to untangle me. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_Tell us about one of your hobbies._   
I like to read pre-teen fiction and play board games.

*[SORTEE member voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*    
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

   _Name:_ **Melina de Souza Leite**.   
&nbsp;

   _Date:_ 2 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

   _Position:_ PhD Candidate.   
&nbsp;

   _Research and/or work interests:_ Community Ecology, Landscape Ecology, Demography.   
&nbsp;

_What's an open science practice or topic that you've changed your views on within the last few years? Why?:_   
I've learned a lot about the importance of standardized data management protocols (at least in the same project!), especially for metadata. Messy data, even if available in open repositories, don't help much! :). 
&nbsp;

_What open/reliable/transparent behaviour have you found difficult to change? Do you have ideas about how this could be made easier?:_   
The problem with package versions and functions that don't work anymore. I've heard of some initiatives, but haven't looked for solutions yet.
&nbsp;

_Where were you born and raised?:_   
I was born and raised in a small fisherman village on the coast of Brazil, surrounded by the Atlantic rainforest and beautiful beaches and islands.
&nbsp;

_Do you have a favorite non-human organism? What is it and why is it your favorite?:_   
The water opossum (Chironectes minimus) is my favorite non-human organism! It is the only semi-aquatic marsupial of the world (and in South/Middle America, not Australia), it has a sixth opposable finger on its front paws, and their hind paws look like they’re from a duck (with membranes). Females have invented the submarine, ‘cause they swim with the offspring inside the pouch (no water goes inside!), and the males also have a pouch to protect their balls from the cold water!! I've radio-tracked some of them in my masters project! 
&nbsp;

_What is something about your work in science that your friends outside of science (or the general public) would find surprising?:_   
For statisticians, I'm a reasonable ecologist. For the ecologists, I know something about statistics. So, not enough in any field... :)

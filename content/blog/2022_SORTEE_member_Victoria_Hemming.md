_If you could recommend one paper to the community of ecologists and evolutionary biologists on an openness / reliability / transparency topic, what paper would you choose?_   
I would recommend the paper by Fraser et al. 2018 "[Questionable Research Practices in Ecology and Evolution](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200303)". It gives a really great overview of the concepts related to Openness, Reproducibility and Transparency in Ecological domains and an indication of the extent to which the practices were upheld (or not).

_What's the last book that affected the way you currently think about things?_   
Two books I've read recently, that I come back to a lot: 
 
1) "Braiding Sweetgrass" (Robin Wall Kimmerer), a wonderful book that braids together Indigenous Knowledge, Western Science, and the teachings of plants (and the environment at large). There is so much in there to reflect on about injustice, hope, and complementary ways of knowing. 
 
2) "I'm right and you're an idiot" (Jomes Hoggan). This book brings together schools of thought related to polarisation, conflict, disengagement, and toxic public discourse.

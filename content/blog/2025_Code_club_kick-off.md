*The Member Engagement Committee runs Code Club every third Tuesday of the month. Time can vary depending on the host and will be announced at least two weeks in advance on [SORTEE’s Slack](https://www.sortee.org/join/). For more information, see [SORTEE’s Code Club page](https://www.sortee.org/code_club/).*  
  
On the 25th of February, we kicked off the SORTEE Code Club for 2025! We had an exciting meeting with 14 SORTEE members where we briefly introduced the aims of Code Club, and its new organizers. Cecilia (Ceci) Baldoni, postdoc at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Radolfzell (Germany), and Corné de Groot, PhD student at the LMU in Munich (Germany), will be hosting and organising Code Club in 2025. We also took a moment to reflect on what Code Club accomplished in 2024, thanks to the previous organiser, Natalie van Dis.   
Code Club is an informal platform where you can develop skills and learn about topics related to coding and open code practices, as well as discuss and share best practice skills. You can find resources related to Code Club on the newly updated [Code Club webpage](https://www.sortee.org/code_club/).   
During the meeting,  participants filled in a survey to gauge their interest in and to pitch future Code Club meeting topics. We will shortly update the [Code Club schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rOOOE7ghPduwtFftG0DJJf0DXVigAdcmQ0xdEwbKQXo/edit?gid=1671163307#gid=1671163307) for 2025 based on the survey results and open discussion.  
Interestingly, nearly all participants- barring one- use R as their primary coding language!  
In addition to Code Club-related questions, the survey included some fun extras.  If SORTEE members could have one superpower, teleportation would be their number one pick! And if you find yourself out of good movies to watch, here are some recommendations by the participants: Dune 2, Parasite, Finding Nemo, The Boat That Rocked, Yintah, The Jockey, Nosferatu, Hellraiser, Lord of the Rings, Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Ladybird and, The Babadook.

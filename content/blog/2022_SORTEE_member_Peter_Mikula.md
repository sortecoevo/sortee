*[SORTEE member voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

   _Name:_ Peter Mikula.   
&nbsp;

   _Date:_ 04 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

   _Position:_ Postdoctoral Researcher.   
&nbsp;

   _Research and/or work interests:_ Macroecology, behavioural ecology, birdsong, geography of fear, conservation culturomics.   
&nbsp;

_What 'ORT' practice have you introduced into your research practice that you've found really helpful?_   
Whenever possible, I publish raw data along with my papers. In ecological studies, it is still a common practice not to publish raw data or to publish transformed data which often can not be used for different research questions. I found it frustrating. But rather than wait for the others, I have changed my own approach.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_Tell us about one of your hobbies._   
I like doing sports (e.g. basketball, cycling, or workouts in the gym). Sport gave me a solid basis for a scientific career as both quite often contain "boring" routines but both are also very important for improving general skills and future progress. Practice makes perfect both in sport and science.

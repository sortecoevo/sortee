*[SORTEE member voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

   _Name:_ Timothy Clark.   
&nbsp;

   _Date:_ 09 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

   _Position:_ Associate Professor.   
&nbsp;

   _Research and/or work interests:_ Eco-physiology of aquatic animals in response to environmental change.   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_What's an 'ORT' subject or practice that you think deserves more attention?_   
Misconduct (e.g., data fabrication) is more widespread than scientists like to accept, and the situation will not improve unless we start openly discussing it, and we give protection/incentives for whistleblowers to come forward if they have robust evidence behind their allegations.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_What's the last book that affected the way you currently think about things?_   
"The diving bell and the butterfly" is a book "written" by a man who suffered locked-in syndrome after a stroke; he relayed his story, letter by letter, by blinking an eyelid to a scribe. This resonated with me, as I spent several months in a similar situation after being struck down by Guillain-Barre syndrome in 2019.

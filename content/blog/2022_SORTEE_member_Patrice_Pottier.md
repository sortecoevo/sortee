*[SORTEE member voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

   _Name:_ Patrice Pottier.   
&nbsp;

   _Date:_ 05 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

   _Position:_ PhD Candidate.   
&nbsp;

   _Research and/or work interests:_ My research mostly revolves around understanding the variation in animals' responses to anthropogenic stressors. I am also interested in animal behaviour, life history and evolution more broadly and I try to make science more open and reproducible..   
&nbsp;

_What 'ORT' practice have you introduced into your research practice that you've found really helpful?_   
I recently decided to preregister the majority of my research projects. Although it seemed intimidating at first, I found preregistration to be a useful step to critically assess the relevance of my research projects. It made me rethink my hypotheses and predictions and made sure my experimental design was suitable to answer my original questions. The analysis and writing part was also very straightforward as I just had to follow my plans!
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_Where were you born and raised?_   
I was born and raised in France.
&nbsp;

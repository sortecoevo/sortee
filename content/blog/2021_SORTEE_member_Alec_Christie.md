*[SORTEE member voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

   _Name:_ Alec Christie.   
&nbsp;

   _Date:_ 02 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

   _Position:_ Postdoctoral Research Associate, University of Cambridge.   
&nbsp;

   _Research and/or work interests:_ I'm interested in how we can provide decision-makers with relevant and reliable scientific evidence to inform their decision-making. I'm also interested in developing decision support tools that help decision-makers combine and assess different sources of evidence (e.g., local knowledge, grey literature, peer-reviewed literature, evidence syntheses) in conservation..   
&nbsp;

_How did you become interested in open research?_   
I think what sparked my interest in this was reading papers about the reproducibility crisis in psychology and medicine and taking part in a study to try to see how consistently researchers built, tested, and communicated models given the same dataset.
&nbsp;

_Do you have a favourite non-human organism? What is it and why is it your favourite?_   
This is a really tough choice. I'm going to restrict myself to organisms that I've seen in real life and I'd go for a Giant Queensland Grouper I saw whilst diving on the SS Yongala in Australia.  It's one animal encounter that really made me gulp as it passed over the top of me. They are massive at around 3m long and weigh around 600kg. And they are lesser known marine organisms deserving of more praise!

*[SORTEE member voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

   _Name:_ Ineta Kačergytė.   
&nbsp;

   _Date:_ 09 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

   _Position:_ doctoral student.   
&nbsp;

   _Research and/or work interests:_ I am working within conservation biology and landscape ecology fields, where I am evaluating restoration and creation initiatives to facilitate biodiversity. I mainly work with bird communities, but also involve amphibians and fish..   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_How did you become interested in open research?_   
It is an increasingly relevant topic. We have been exposed to the difficulties, dangers, and ethics of current research transparency from the early career stage. I think my colleagues, structured courses, open discussion during conferences and other platforms, as well as relevant publications made me interested in this topic.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_Tell us about a teacher who helped you enjoy learning:_   
That would definitely be Dennis Hasselquist from Lund university. He is undoubtedly one of the most engaging and motivated teachers I have enjoyed learning from. The love for the research he does shows and inspires others. All the discussions led to thorough analyses and stimulating evolutionary thinking that helped me develop as a researcher, thinking about more than one possible interpretation and building strong reasoning.

_Name:_ Erlend B. Nilsen.   

_Date:_ 9 July 2021. 
&nbsp;

_Position:_ Senior researcher / Professor.  
&nbsp;

_Research and/or work interests:_   
I'm an applied quantitative ecologist, working mainly
with bird and mammal populations. I'm particularly interested in human impacts (such as climate change, harvest, and land use patterns) on these species' populations, including distribution, abundance demography, and life  history traits. To address these challenges, we statistical analyses of empirical dat and simulation of studies. Lately, I have also been involved in research in disease ecology. In addition, I have a strong  interest in how we manage hard-won ecological data to the best of the research community and society at large.

_How did you become interested in open research?_   
Since I started as a biology student, I have always been interested in the philosophy of science, including how scientific progress is made.  This later sparked my interest in learning more about (and doing my best to follow) ORT research practices, which are fundamental for  responsible science. Working mainly with applied research questions, I also frequently experience the importance and benefits of ORT, both for creating trust in science and also at a more personal level when communicating and presenting my own work. This interest has also connected me with other researchers that share a similar interest in  ORT, from across a broad range of scientific disciplines. These connections have been very inspiring and further increased my interest in this topic.   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_Where were you born and raised?_   
I was born and raised in Trøndelag County in Central Norway (where I still live).
